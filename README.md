# augmentations_medical_images

This code corresponds to our Nature Medicine paper on
 "Generative models improve fairness of medical classifiers under
  distribution shifts".
In this codebase we release models (both classifiers and generative models) for
the [Camelyon17K dataset](https://wilds.stanford.edu/datasets/).

## Usage

All code is in CoLABS.
